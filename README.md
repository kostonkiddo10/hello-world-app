# hello-world-app
CS-250 initial Android app to test the waters of Kotlin. It's purpose is converting temperatures and length between imperial -> metric units.

Currently only works for Android API 31 because why not. NOT SMART FOR CREATING ACTUAL APPS; TRY TO TARGET THE MOST COMMONLY USED API FIRST.

Warning: Code will be janky because professor wanted us to follow him and do it quickly. :'(
